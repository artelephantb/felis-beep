# Felis Beep
*Felis Beep* is an extension for [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com), to add [BeepBox](https://beepbox.co) into [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)!

> [!WARNING]
> Felis Beep does not save BeepBox songs and will be reset when switching tabs or closing the Scratch project, this does not apply to songs that are in the Scratch sound layers.

## Usage
In the [Scratch project editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor), the *Sounds* tab had been replaced with a *Audio* tab; The Audio tab is where the BeepBox editor is located. After pressing the *Switch Mode* button in the Audio tab, you will see the BeepBox ui and a set of controls. For usage in BeepBox, use the [BeepBox website](https://www.beepbox.co) (you may have to scroll down).

### Save Button
This button is different from the project's save button because this is the **only button that can save BeepBox songs**. The songs are stored in a joint location that can be accessed through every project. If you try to save a song with a name that already exists, the old song will be replaced **without warning**.

### Load Button
When pressed, the current song **will be replaced** with the desired song.

### Build Button
The only button without a popup, this button *imports* the current BeepBox song into the Scratch sound layers.

## License
*BeepBox* (`beepbox` directory and colors in `main.css`) are under the MIT license (see beepbox-license.txt) and the rest of the project is also under the MIT license (see license.txt).

## Notice
*Felis Beep* is in no way affiliated nor endorsed by BeepBox, Scratch, the Scratch Foundation, or the Scratch Team.

*Scratch* is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. See the [Scratch Website](https://scratch.mit.edu).
